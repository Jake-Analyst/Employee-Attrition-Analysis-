#  Employee Attrition Dashboard  

### Excel | Power BI | HR Analytics  

## Executive Summary  
The **Employee Attrition Dashboard** provides a data-driven understanding of the factors influencing employee turnover within an organization.  
The goal was to identify patterns and insights that could help HR teams make informed decisions on employee retention.  

This project follows a complete analytics workflow — from **data cleaning and transformation in Excel** to **interactive visualization in Power BI**.  
The dashboard enables management to track attrition across departments, analyze demographic trends, and uncover key drivers such as income and job satisfaction.  

## Business Problem  
Employee attrition was increasing, leading to higher recruitment costs and productivity loss. The HR team lacked a clear understanding of:  
- Which departments were losing the most employees  
- What demographic or income factors influenced turnover  
- How job satisfaction and compensation affected retention  

This analysis aimed to use data to uncover *why employees were leaving* and *how to prevent it*.  

## Methodology  
This section details how the dashboard was created from start to finish.  

### Step 1: Data Collection  
- Obtained a **public HR dataset** from Kaggle containing employee demographics, job details, and attrition status.  
- The dataset included fields such as Department, Age, Gender, Monthly Income, Education, and Job Satisfaction.  

### Step 2: Data Cleaning (Excel)  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing values.  
- Standardized categorical fields (e.g., “Sales” vs “sales”).  
- Ensured data consistency for numerical fields like *Monthly Income* and *Age*.  

### Step 3: Data Modeling (Power BI)  
- Imported cleaned and transformed data into Power BI.  
- Created new measures to ensure that clear and reliable insights are drawn from the charts and card visuals

### Step 5: Dashboard Design (Power BI)  
- Designed an **interactive dashboard** with:  
  - card visuals showing Total Employees, Total employees, average number of years each employee worked in the company, the percentage number of employees working overtime, average monthly incomeand Attrition Rate  
  - Bar and column charts comparing attrition by Department, Marital Status, Percentage Salary Hike and Gender  
  - Line graph showing the relationship between salary hike and performance and Monthly income by attrition 
- Used consistent color themes and layouts for readability and impact.  

## Skills Demonstrated  
- **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Excel for handling missing data and standardizing fields
- **Data Modeling** – Relationship setup and measure creation in Power BI  
- **Data Visualization** – Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- **Business Insight Development** – Turned analytical results into actionable recommendation


## Results & Insights  
- **Sales** and **Research & Development** departments had the **highest attrition rates**  
- **Married people and the Male gender ** showed higher turnover  
- **Low monthly income** and strongly correlated with attrition  
- **Gender differences** were minimal but slightly higher among males
- **Salary Increment** led to increased performance 

## Business Recommendations  
- **Review salary structures** to ensure fair compensation for lower-income employees  
- **Create mentorship and career growth programs** for married employees  
- **Use data monitoring** to track retention metrics continuously
- Allocate more resources for high performing job roles


## Next Steps  
- Integrate **predictive analytics** to forecast future attrition risks  
- Include **exit interview data** for deeper insights  
- Build additional HR dashboards (recruitment pipeline, promotion trends)  
- Automate data refreshes in Power BI Service for real-time tracking  


## Conclusion  
This project demonstrates the complete analytics workflow — from raw data cleaning to insightful visualization.  
The dataset was originally drawn from Kaggle and was used to simulate a real-world scenario where an HR department requested an analysis of employee attrition trends to support strategic decision-making.
The dashboard helps HR departments move from reactive problem-solving to proactive, data-driven retention strategies.
